# 👋 Hi, I’m Cindy Karanja  
### 🛠️ Software Engineer | 🔐 Cybersecurity Enthusiast | 🌍 Problem-Solver

Welcome to my portfolio!

I’m a developer passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems—especially in health, food security, and community impact. With experience in mobile and web development (mainly using **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and modern web tools), I build apps that are not only functional but secure and user-focused.

Currently, I’m deepening my skills in **cybersecurity**, exploring areas like **ethical hacking**, **secure software development**, and **data privacy**.  
My mission? To build tech that empowers users while keeping their data safe.

📁 **Explore my projects**,  
💬 **Connect with me**, or  
👀 **Stick around to see what I’m building next.**

I’m always open to collaborations, opportunities, and conversations around secure, ethical, and impactful tech.
